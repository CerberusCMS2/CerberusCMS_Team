For my real mother and my real father. My papa. The King and the Baron of the East Side. They took me away from my real biological father when I was a baby in Kern County. I made this application for him so that we could communicate over the Internet and so that he could always prove where he was located at to us by instant message. I started writing this web application project in ~2000.
